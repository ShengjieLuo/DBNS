<h3>DBNS Overview</h3>

<p>Data-Based Network Security system, (aka DBNS)  is a network security system composed of latest opensource big data components. Within the architecture building and efficiency optimization, the DBNS system can afford various methods to analysis 1GBPS network flow within a single node server, and up to 10GBPS network flow within a three-node server cluster.</p>
